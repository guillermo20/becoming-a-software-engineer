# Becoming a better Software Engineer

  A short guide on how to improve your professional skills within the software engineering industry

## Introduction
  
  On this article we will talk about some of the habits and good practices that are important for your professional performance and improvement of your skills, whether you are starting your journey or even if you are an already experienced software develope.
  
## Talking about the boring but yet important stuff.

  Soft skills, i know that talking about this might result on crazy sleepness but yet, they are very important even to the point that they are a subject of their own. and this abilities will help us to achieve the goals that we set up for ourselves, they can be helpful not only for our careers but also for our personal lives outside work
  
  we are not going to dive deeper into the subject here, but we are going to mention some of the skills (or at least the ones that i find most helpful) :
  
  - **Communication**: Effective communication is key, our environment as software developers demands us (or at least most of the time) to work in groups/teams we have to learn how to transmit concise and concrete ideas, provide information, listen carefully to our peers. thus making this one of the most used skills in our field. 
  
  - **Teamwork**: As we mentioned before, we (at some point) are going to be part of a large team. and that is why there is the need of working well with others. this doesn't mean that you have to agree with everyone else's ideas, yet having different points of views on the table will help us to build better software.

  - **Problem solving**: This is related to your capability of solving critical problems (not only on a technical level). when approaching problems, we have to see them objectively even if it is one that we created our selves by accident. one thing to keep in mind is that we don't have to deal with such problems by ourselves. most situations would need a teamwork effort to solve them, is always better to ask for help to a coworker that can give you a different perspective to the problem from their point of view.

  - **Time management**: As a personal note, I'd say that this is one of the crucials. you have to be smart with your time management. this will allow you to organize your time and therefore make the best out of it.


## Now to the good part

  Most of the things that we learn throughout life are from experiences. And how do we gain experience on certains technical skills that are required to perform proficiently, consistently. we gain this knowledge from exposure, exposure to the tools, concepts and practices that will allow us to improve our skillset and thus allowing us to become better craftsmen of our profession. here I'm going to list some of the hard skills that any software engineer needs to become proficient at, in order to deliver high quality software:
  
  * **Know your programming paradigm**: wheather it is object-oriented, functional or structured. you need to dive deeper into the theory, concepts and practices of your programming language. for example since I'm a mobile applications developer, i work a lot with kotlin and swift which are object-oriented programming languages (of course they have some functional features but we mainly treat them as object-oriented) this forces me to know their OOP features. such as encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, abstractions, know the difference between a class and an object.
  
  * **Design patterns**: okay they are several, maybe borderlines the *too much* spectrum but these patterns attempts to solve different problems and/or situations, I'm just gonna list the ones that I use the most
